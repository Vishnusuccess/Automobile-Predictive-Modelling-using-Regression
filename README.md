Transformed the label value to make it more symmetric and closer to a Normal distribution.
Aggregated categories of a categorical variable to improve the statistical representation.
Scaled the numeric features.
Recoded the categorical features as binary dummy variables.
Fit the linear regression model using scikit-learn.
Evaluated the performance of the model using both numeric and graphical methods.

It is clear from the outcome of the performance evaluation that this model needs to be improved. As it is, the model shows poor generalization.
